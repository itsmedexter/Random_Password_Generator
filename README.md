# Random Password Generator

A password generator created in HTML, Bootstrap, and Javascript. Javascript is comprised of basic use  prompts, if/else statements, loops, getElements. When the page opens, it gives you prompts how to get your password, then generates one with random numbers, letters, special characters. 

# Challenges

First thing, I should read the README directions carefull. I started doing the prompts all wrong, not until Mahisha tiped me about how it should react.

Second, I will try to pseudo code before I begin. I started throwing random codes on a page with no direction. If I had a game plan, it would have saved more time. Giving me extra time to worry about when my code doesn't work. Oh wait, that was this project. :p
